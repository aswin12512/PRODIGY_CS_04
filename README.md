# Simple Keylogger

This is a simple keylogger implemented in Python that records and logs keystrokes to a file. The keylogger uses the `pynput` library to monitor keyboard input and save the logged keys to a text file.

> **Important**: This project is intended for educational purposes only. Always ensure you have explicit permission to log keystrokes on any device, and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
